            Chess is a timeless strategic board game played between two opponents, each controlling an army of 16 pieces: a king, queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, placing it in a position where it cannot escape capture. Chess blends tactical maneuvers and long-term planning, requiring players to anticipate their opponent's moves while safeguarding their own pieces. Each piece moves differently, adding complexity and depth to the game. The queen is the most powerful, while pawns can be promoted upon reaching the opposite side of the board. Originating in India over a thousand years ago, chess has evolved into a globally recognized intellectual sport, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving. Played casually or competitively, chess remains a symbol of mental agility, discipline, and creativity, with millions worldwide engaging in its intricate challenges.
